## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### Continued development

- Responsiveness - there are a lot of screen sizes where the site breaks.
- DRY Javascript - my javascript code could use a major clean up. 


### Useful resources

- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - this helped with positioning the cards.
- [setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) - for making thing disappear after a certain amount of time.
